Welp, that was painful.
In Part 1, I moved fairly quickly thanks to my existing Grid 
and Direction classes, which meant I already had code for 
moving a long a grid in a given direction *and* for rotating 
that direction.
For Part 2, I basically gave up any pretension of coming up
with a general solution that can fold any cube, and instead
focused on the layout of the input, painstakingly figuring out
how each edge would wrap to another edge. So, the solution below
won't work with the sample input, but it *should* work with
other inputs where the cube sides are laid out the same way.
Like a lot of people, I ended up crafting an actual cube so
I could get all the wrapping correct. You can see a picture
