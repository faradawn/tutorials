Day 24

2nd star: 12:06:41 (*)
(*) I was on vacation this day, so I didn't solve it until
    the morning after.
I approached this problem as a breadth-first search where you
had to account for the fact that the map changes at each step,
which means you're really doing a BFS through a three-dimensional
space (where time is the third dimension)
The main insight is realizing that the position of the blizzards
repeats every lcm(width, height) steps. Given the relatively
small size of the maps, you can just pre-compute the position
of the blizzards at every step, instead of computing them
on-the-fly during the BFS.
