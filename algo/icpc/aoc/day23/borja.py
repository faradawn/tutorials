Day 23

2nd star: 00:59:47
This was a fun "Game of Life" style problem where you just
had to be very careful about implementing every condition
correctly. I was glad that Part 2 was pretty straightforward
(in fact, I basically had all the code for it ready to go because
I had spent a bit of time implementing a "print_elves" function
that had to compute the minimum rectangle). After Day 21,
I was afraid Part 2 was going to involve some massive twist 
like "after 1,000,000 rounds, the elves will end up forming 
a polygon of N sides. Find N"
