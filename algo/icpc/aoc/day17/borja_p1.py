Part 1 of this problem turned out to be a fun exercise in
object-oriented design (as well as ensuring that every
small detail was right). Keeping the code well organized
(and testing each method as I went along) meant that,
when all the pieces (ha!) came together, I got the right
answer for Part 1 with minimal debugging.
As for Part 2... clearly I couldn't simulate a bajillion
pieces, so I tried to see whether there was any patterns
I could exploit. Eventually, I tried printing the height 
of the rocks every time I made a full pass through all 
the movements (before you cycle back to the start), and 
it turned out the rocks actually grow by the same amount 
each cycle. I ended up using that information to manually
compute the answer, but I'll eventually get around
to adding code that finds out that value automatically.
