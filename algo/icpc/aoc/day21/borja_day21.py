Part I just involved building an expression tree and evaluating it.
For Part II, I initially came up with a solution that was way more
complicated than it needed to be: I ran BFS to find the path from the
root to the "humn" node, and then passed that path to a recursive function
that would explore the tree in that order, figuring out the intermediate
values in each node so we could finally compute the value of "humn".
This took a while to write, and the intuition behind the approach
wasn't wrong: I needed a mechanism to distinguish "branches that
can be fully evaluated" from "branches that have the humn node
somewhere down the branch". I ended up rewriting my code almost
entirely so that the evaluation function (eval() below) would
save the evaluated value of a node, unless it was impossible
to do so (because there was a missing value). This then made it
much easier to start at the root and figure out which branch
contained the "humn" node and which one didn't.
