    This function parses the input into a graph *and* converts it

        PP -- QQ --  RR -- SS  
        17    00     00    22
    We'll never stop in QQ or RR because their valves have a flow
    rate of zero, so the above really represents the following:
        PP ------- SS

    By removing these "intermediate zero flow nodes" we can greatly
    simplify the graph, and reduce the problem state (in the provided
    input, you go from a 66-node graph to a 16-node graph)
    On top of that, this function also runs Floyd–Warshall on the graph,
    as the pairwise distance between nodes will come in very handy.
